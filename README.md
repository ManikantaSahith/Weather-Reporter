# PHP-Weather-Scraper
A PHP project, a user enters a city into the input box, a GET request is then sent to a PHP script. The PHP script then pulls the relevant weather data from a target URL which is then displayed to the user. This project may seem relatively simple as a PHP project but I think it shows that I can work well with HTML, CSS and PHP and I think the code is clean, logical and commented to make it clearer to whoever's reading it.
